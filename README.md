# Capstone-2
My second Springboard's Capstone project

The second capstone, had four phases:
1.	Research and find the dataset to analyze
2.	Data cleaning and initial analysis using Python
3.	In depth analyze of the dataset and visualize it
4.	Present the findings by creating 3 different presentations:

    1. Executive Slide Deck
    2. Technical Slide Deck
    3. Non-Technical Slide Deck

The dataset I chose to work on in this capstone, was taken from Kaggle and collected behavior data for 5 months (Oct 2019 â€“ Feb 2020) from a medium cosmetics online store. You can find this dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-events-history-in-cosmetics-shop.
Because the data was so heavy (more than 20M rows), and it was hard to upload it to Tableau Public, I focused only on three months - November 2019, December 2019 and January 2020.

The Problem Statement I wanted to solve by using insights from analyzing the dataset was: 
What opportunities exist for the eCommerce cosmetic website to increase their monthly revenue by 10% in the next year by reducing cart abandonment or by brand/product restructuring?

Please see attached how I cleaned the data and performed an initial analysis in Python. 


And here is how I performed in depth analysis and visualized it in Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/profile/shira.balint8379#!/vizhome/Capstone2-eCommerceCostmeticswebsite/MonthlyRevenue

Thank you!
